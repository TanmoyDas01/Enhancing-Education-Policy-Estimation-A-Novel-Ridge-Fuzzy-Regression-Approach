# Enhancing Education Policy Estimation: A Novel Ridge Fuzzy Regression Approach for Handling Multicollinearity with Fuzzy Input Data
Multicollinearity often complicates regression analysis, both in classical and fuzzy input
setup. This research introduces a new approach that combines ridge regression with
fuzzy regression to tackle correlated covariate’s impact, with a specific focus on improving
education policy systems. Our method utilizes the α-level estimation algorithm and
a dataset where Grade Point Average (GPA) serves as a fuzzy input, while input variables
remain crisp. We assess our estimator’s performance using RMSE and MAPE. This
applied research showcases the potential of our method in enhancing education policies
through more accurate data-driven decision-making.
